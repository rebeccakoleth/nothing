<h1>The Truth, For Once</h1>
<p>I hate writing.</p>
<p>
When I was younger, I loved writing fantastical stories about defeating ridiculous villains, disturbing my wonderful third-grade teacher with the gory depictions I’d stolen from the Stephen King novels my mom let me check out from the library. I would fill marbled composition notebooks with magic and even let my classmates request heroic cameos before passing my writings along, sandwiched between their black-and-white cardboard covers. I wrote and wrote and wrote. I wrote whatever I could whenever I could, and I read my stories aloud to my classmates, recording the sound of their laughter in my brain to cherish later. I created worlds entirely built from slips of imagination, as untruthful as fantasy can be, and yet I find that those stories may be the last honest thing I have ever written.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to be a writer. Or a singer, but I never felt brave enough for that. Now, I realize that writing takes a certain bravery, which I must admit I don’t have. I can tag on a ‘yet,’ if that makes my reader feel better, if it provides a false sense of hope that prevents any lingering. Or perhaps I’ll put up a ‘No Loitering’ sign beside these honest sentences. 
</p>
<p>
This summer, I started a blog just to practice writing. No, not really just to practice writing. I actually simply enjoyed the idea of having a blog, of little curated pieces of me laid out to dry, even if only a few select people read what I wrote. I think I wrote around ten posts about various things: music I love, time with friends, a horrendous baking fail, feelings I don’t like confronting, and maybe a few other things. To be honest, as I’m trying to be, I deleted that blog today, and I’m not sure how I feel about that action. Perhaps I’m avoiding myself.
</p>
<p>
I can’t remember the last time I’ve been proud of something I’ve written. I’m always told that I should be proud, that I don’t give myself enough credit, blah blah blah, but I don’t believe it, or maybe I can’t. I am not a proud person. I am guilty of the desperation to please that Smith references, and I am particularly guilty of hoping my truth fits the assignment parameters, hoping it makes someone feel something and know me. But unfortunately, I don’t know what I’m doing, and I’m more interested in painting a self-portrait of metacognition, maturity, and thoughtfulness. 
</p>
<p>
My blog posts might have been the most honest writings I’ve formed since third grade. I’m not saying there is no performative aspect to them, because there definitely is, otherwise I wouldn’t have felt the blood pumping so strongly through my heart when pushing my markdown file filled with thoughts on fear out to my published site. That might be why I deleted them, and why I miss them, even as I’m glad they’re gone without an easy trace. There are times when I simply don’t want to give any part of myself away, when I want to take back words already read, already written. Should I start a new blog?
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried journaling, I’ve tried being true, and I’ve tried lying. Literary inauthenticity and literary failure are the same, and I hate to call my work failure even as I believe it, but I’ve found that the line between hate and love easily dissolves, blurring, becoming one if I stand close enough and let my eyes unfocus. My writing, even in my blog posts, even the ones addressed to my friends, is edgy and sad. I hate it. It makes me feel lonely, unbearably so, and I can do nothing other than laugh and simplify it to teenage-girl angst. It’s hormones, I swear. 
</p>
<p>
Surely there is something that is overwhelmingly truthful about writing that is only written to be deleted. Hopefully, I’m not just trying to make myself feel better, but can there be any kind of writing more honest, more authentic, than writing that was written once for you to let out, to read back, and to delete forever? Is there anything more truthful than not writing for anyone, not even yourself? All I can do now is offer a one-sentence summary of the thousands of words I wrote for that blog, in those composition notebooks, all the hundreds of comma splices condensed into only what I can hold in my memory.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think there is any beauty to be found in this essay, and I believe that’s my intention. I strain to remember what I’ve written, to pick out any writing that wasn’t a failure, but I may be too self-aware to achieve true honesty. It’s curated, it’s formed with ideas of how it will be received, how it will fall flat, how it will move. 
</p>
<p>
I hate writing, because I ask to be honest, and I fail. What was so honest about those stories? Do I just miss the way I was when I was young, before I learned to lie, before I learned to hold my face just so, to say whatever I knew needed to be heard? I don’t mean for this to be sad, or disappointing, or blunt, or whatever it may be. I don’t mean for it to lead to a question or a conversation, but this essay can’t be flowery, or it won’t be true. When I write, it’s usually negative, and when we come to the end, I want to hold my reader’s hand and tell them not to worry. I want them to leave with a relieved sigh, for them to feel the tension resolve, and sit back in their chairs and go about their day without a heavy feeling. Why burden someone with the truth?
</p>
<p>
My essay on place felt selfish. It felt truthful and awful. Of course, I went into the writing process hoping to make my reader feel stuck. I wanted them to feel a bit sick, to want to stop reading, and not be able to stop. I gave that burden over, forced them to share a terrible truth with me. To tell the truth, writing about myself—even with the sheer coverage that metaphor lets me hide behind—makes me feel a bit sick. To tell one more truth, writing about writing also makes me feel sick, and I’ve checked the word count on this essay about five times by now. Six now. 
</p>
<p>
It’s just too much. Do you ever feel that way? I want to retract every statement I make as soon as I make it. I want to erase every keystroke as it clicks into place, the same way I sometimes want to delete every photo I’ve ever taken, to delete my accounts, to clear my desktop, to crumple pages upon pages of old writings and send them to become recycled mush. Does that make any sense? Is that relatable at all? Does my writing need to feel relatable? Writing only feels right when it’s relatable, when someone can take your words and take their world and find a few tethers to tie them to you. I don’t know how true it is. I don’t know how right I am. I guess in every truth there is something malleable enough to connect. 
</p>
<p>
Failing better, for me at least, means telling the truth even if it’s negative, and even if nobody likes it. To tell a truth, I may have deleted my blog, but all my posts live in a Google Doc that I avoid opening. To tell another truth, being brave means letting people read all my terrible writings in hopes that they can find some part of me flailing in a net of words. I think I owe that to myself.
